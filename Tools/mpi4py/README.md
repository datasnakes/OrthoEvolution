## multiprocessing module

The multiprocessing module will allow us to make use of the MCSR's PBS script functionality via the ```mpi4py``` package.
## Description

Originally this was used for the FTP downloads.  It is currently under development for project wide use.
The following need to be added:
- [ ] Start function
- [ ] Function to split things into a nested list
- [ ] Function to create JSON file for each process
- [ ] Remove functions from the ftp2db script and put here
- [ ] Add parameters for this module
    - [ ] MP script
    - [ ] Script type (language)
        - [ ] Add a script for calling these types (e.g. python3 script.py; R app.R)
    - [ ] Number of processes
    - [ ] Nested list to be split
    - [ ] Flag for keeping default PBS(.sh) script or generating a custom one
- [ ] Look into the other multiprocessing thing I linked on SLACK

## Usage

Usage will be more concisely described after this module is update.

A PBS script is called like this:

```bash
$ qsub UPLOAD.sh
```
Here is what the current PBS script looks like:
```pbs
#PBS -S /bin/bash
#PBS -m bea
#PBS -M rgilmore@umc.edu
#PBS -l select=8:ncpus=1:mem=16gb -l place=free
#PBS -l cput=24:00:00
#PBS -l walltime=32:00:00
#PBS -N robupload
#PBS -o /work5/r2294/DATA/PycharmProjects/GPCR_Orthologs/GPCR-Orthologs-Project/CODE/Lib/Log/robupload.o${PBS_JOBID}
#PBS -e /work5/r2294/DATA/PycharmProjects/GPCR_Orthologs/GPCR-Orthologs-Project/CODE/Lib/Log/robupload.e${PBS_JOBID}
#PBS -j oe
cd ${PBS_O_WORKDIR}
rm /work5/r2294/DATA/PycharmProjects/GPCR_Orthologs/GPCR-Orthologs-Project/CODE/1_Databases/NCBI_Data/refseq/release/vertebrate_mammalian/robupload.o*
rm /work5/r2294/DATA/PycharmProjects/GPCR_Orthologs/GPCR-Orthologs-Project/CODE/1_Databases/NCBI_Data/refseq/release/vertebrate_mammalian/robupload.e*
mpiexec python /work5/r2294/DATA/PycharmProjects/GPCR_Orthologs/GPCR-Orthologs-Project/CODE/1_Databases/NCBI_Data/refseq/release/vertebrate_mammalian/multi_dbupload.py
echo "end"
```

This module is strictly a python driven module.  ```mpi4py``` is used like so:

```python
from mpi4py import MPI

# Get child process information
comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD

# The rank is unique to each process.
# For 8 parallel processes there will be a rank 0-7
rank = comm.Get_rank()
# Currently unused variable in my scripts
size = comm.Get_size()
machine = platform.node()
```
