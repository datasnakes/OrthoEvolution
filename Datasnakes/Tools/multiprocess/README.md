Multiprocess
=============
The multiprocess module and class, `MultiPro`, use python's native multiprocessing
module. Find more information [here](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/multiprocessing.html).

In order to take advantage of using our supercomputer's processing power, we
looked into mpi and multiprocessing. Both were found to be useful.

This is an optional class in our pipeline, but if you're using AWS or Google's
supercomputing, then you may find it useful.
