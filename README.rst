OrthoEvolution
====================
OrthoEvolution is an **easy to use** and comprehensive python package which aids in the **analysis and
visualization of comparative evolutionary genetics** related projects such as the **inference of orthologs**.

Overview
--------------------------
This package focuses on **inferring orthologs** using NCBI's blast, various sequence alignment strategies,
and phylogenetics analyses including PAML, PhyML, ete3, and more tools.

Ultimately, the goal of this project is to create a **reusable pipeline** for the
inference of orthologs in order to ensure reproducibility of data as well as improve
the management and analysis of (what can be) large datasets.  The Cookies, Manager, Pipeline,
and Tools modules act as a framework for our workflow, while the Orthologs
module provides access to specific functions for our various ortholog inference projects.

View our `read the docs <http://orthoevolution.readthedocs.io/en/master/>`__ and feel free to also
