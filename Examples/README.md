This folder provides some standalone scripts, data examples, and additional
examples that should help in using this package.

#### Pipeline Example

This package has been optimized to input a single gene/refseq accession number
and return useful PAML (codeml) analysis. The following example will take you
through each step in the pipeline in a quick and simple way.

``` python
