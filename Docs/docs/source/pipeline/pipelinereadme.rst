Pipeline Documentation
======================

The Pipeline module is designed to provide the user with easily callable
and command line usable pipelines that allow orthology inference to be
completed in a parallel fashion.

Soon, there will be many preconfigured pipelines that you can run if you
are using a cluster (**specifically one that uses pbspro or sun grid
engine**).
