PyBasher
========

A user-friendly Bash module for Python.

It was inspired by Alex Couper's
`bash <https://github.com/alexcouper/bash>`__ package.

Background
----------

While learning to use a Linux/Unix shell with Python, I realized that
Python's native shell modules are often clunkier and more difficult to
use than simply using the Bash shell. That lead me to start using
``os.system`` although I realized that ``subprocess.call`` gave me more
control of standard output. This module/package will seek to simplify a
number of useful bash commands & make them easier to incorporate into
python scripts.

Usage
