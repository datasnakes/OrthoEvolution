Orthologs Documentation
-------------------------

This top level module includes submodules such as Align (for aligning multi fasta files), Phylogenetics (for analyzing multiple sequence alignments), BioSQL (for database creation), Blast (includes tools for using NCBI's blastn command line), and Genbank (for tools to extract features from genbank files).

Usage
-----

These tools are optimized to be used together (very little work to do that), but can also be used singularly.


#### Simple Example

This is a simple example of using some of the modules.

``` python
from Orthologs import Phylogenetics

```

Tests
-----

Tests will be added soon.
